# auto_install
Bash script for PIDtoolbox installation on Linux

Thanks to Brian White for his excellent software, which will allow us to enjoy our hobby. This software is the best one for tunning your Quadcopters https://pidtoolbox.com and now is working on Linux. By following Brian's documentation for the installation so I wrote a simple script to help the installation process easier. 

Once you download and unzip the PIDtoolbox file go to the installer folder and place this file named auto_install.sh, change it to executable by typing this in the terminal `$chmod 755 auto_install.sh` hit enter, and execute it `$./auto_install.sh` This will allow you on one click to run the software
